    Then the Event "cr_dlq" shows field "error_msg" with message "Message Abandoned"
    And the Changed Event is stored in dynamo db

    Then the Event "processor" shows field "message" with message "Sequence id is smaller than the existing one"

    Examples: These are both lower than the default sequence-id values
      | seqid |
